# GBCT: Generalized Box–Cox Transformation

We propose the **Generalized Box–Cox Transformation (GBCT)**, a nonlinear scaling method that alleviates multiscale stiffness by compressing multi-magnitude data. Integrated into our data-driven framework, *i.e.* **DeePODE**, GBCT shows improved performance across diverse stiff ODE and PDE benchmarks.
